### Learn PyTorch — Quick Self-Study Guide

## 1) Introduction
This repository is a compact starting point for self-learning PyTorch. It outlines what PyTorch is, why it is useful for deep learning and experimentation, and how to navigate the included materials.

## 2) Installation
Overview of installing PyTorch with pip or conda for both CPU and GPU setups, plus a quick way to verify your environment. Choose the method that fits your platform and hardware.

## 3) PyTorch in 1 Minute
A high-level view of core concepts: tensors (GPU-ready arrays), autograd (automatic differentiation), and `nn.Module` (building blocks for neural networks).

## 4) Minimal Neural Network
A brief description of defining a small model, selecting a loss function and optimizer, and running a short training loop to update parameters.

## 5) Using GPU
How to move models and tensors to the same device (CPU or CUDA) and common pitfalls when mixing devices.

## 6) Suggested Learning Path
A practical progression: tensors and operations → autograd → building models with `nn.Module` → training and evaluation loops → data pipelines (`Dataset`, `DataLoader`) → saving/loading models.

## 7) Resources
Pointers to official documentation, tutorials, and the platform-specific installation guide to go deeper and stay up to date.

## 8) Tips and Common Pitfalls
Quick advice on avoiding device mismatch, handling gradient accumulation correctly, and ensuring reproducibility when needed.

## 9) Project Structure
